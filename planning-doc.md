# Planning Doc #

## General Concept and the "Why" ##

- A website to promote my boyfriend's music because he's so busy writing and producing that he doesn't have much time to focus on promotion.
- Single-page website broken down into different sections with hamburger button navbar to jump around

## Components ##

### High Priority ###

- Nav bar
  - Links to pages
  - Links to socials (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Instagram, BandCamp)
- Home page
  - Logo/name
  - Space for a headline to be updated as needed (ex: New single out now!)
- Music page
  - Images of album covers, with links to listen to them
- About page
  - Photos of Sam
  - Description about him, how long he's been making music, etc.

### Low Priority or Future Consideration ###

- Music page improvements
  - Clicking on an album opens up a mini page with links to select your preferred streaming service
  
  !["Album cover with links to listen on different streaming services listed below it."](https://i.ibb.co/41xs0wj/Capture.png)
  
- Tour/Upcoming Shows page
  - Available for future use when he has live gigs
- Other Projects page
  - He has another group that he's a part of, promote it here
- Latest/Upcoming page
  - Displays latest releases
  - Or maybe it's more like "here's what I'm working on"
  - Not sure yet
